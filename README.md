## Assignments

Homework will be assigned (almost) every day. Expect anything that's assigned on Thursday to take significantly longer than the weekday assignments.

A detailed explanation of what's expected, including a specific outline of deliverables, and any assets needed to complete the assignment will be posted in a folder in this repository.

#### Submission Instructions

1. Create a new GitHub repository for this assignment, named after what you're making. (This is going to from a large part of your portfolio after you're done at The Iron Yard and applying to jobs.)
2. Get everything working.
3. Make sure everything is committed, and you've pushed all the code up to GitHub.
4. Find the "issue" for this assignment that's been created for you in this repository.
5. Make a comment with
    * A link to your GitHub repo,
    * Any struggles or difficulties you had, and
    * Emoji

I'll take a look at your code and give you feedback on it. If the issue is marked as **Closed**, consider it done. I may mark it as **Needs Review** if there are issues. Don't panic, but you should go back and address them and submit it again.

#### Late Assignments

Homework submissions are due at **3:00 am** the morning of class. (We don't encourage you to see this deadline often, if ever, but we understand that some people just naturally work best as nightowls.)

Any homework submitted after the deadline is considered late. As with the absence policy, if you submit homework late 4 times during the class, your career support is forfeit. (I'd recommend never doing it.)

I'd much, much rather see a solid attempt on time than a perfect attempt afterwards.

#### Honor Code

You're all adults; you are expected to do your own work. (Why else would you be here?)

The guiding ethical principle in all of your assignments should be: if I point to a line or block in the code that you've written, you should be able to tell me what it's doing, and why you wrote it that way.

You are (usually) free to use open source projects in doing your work, and always encouraged to read and learn from (not plagiarize) their source code.

While learning what to Google and when is an important part of being a developer, it's important that you use these assignments as a learning opportunity to practice now what you'll be required to do professionally in a few months. As a result, resist the temptation to copy/paste piece of code you find online, especially ones that you don't understand.
