## HTML and CSS Introduction

### Description

Everyone has to ship code on day 1 :)

### Objectives

##### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Understand the building blocks of web development
* Understand how and why to use Chrome DevTools
* Be comfortable with the general requirements for submitting assignments :)

##### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* HTML
* CSS
* Chrome DevTools ("Element" panel)
* Codepen
* Github issues

### Details

#### Deliverables

* Links to your Codepen(s)

### Normal Mode

Create a Codepen that contains at least **10** distinct HTML tags, and **10** different CSS properties.

Your HTML should be valid, and go at least four levels deep.

Your CSS should be valid and use at least three complex selectors. You should use all three of the `display` properties that we introduced today: `block`, `inline-block`, and `inline`.

### Hard Mode

In addition to normal mode, take a look at [this Codepen](http://codepen.io/kylf/pen/OPmvew?editors=110). It's a reproduction of an actual problem that I helped a friend with recently -- the HTML in his page wasn't valid, and as a result there were a few rendering bugs.

* text starts getting bold for no reason
* some content is shifted over to the left

Make a fork of the Codepen (just hit the "Fork" button on the top) and fix the HTML bugs.
